# Lloyds Techical test

Thank you for taking the time to look at my test 

This project was created using the latest version of xcode with a iphone 15 pro simulator running ios 17.2

## Points for improvement 

Given more time I would implement the following:

Implement UI testing to cover the the hompage flow from list to detail view

In the case of the Currency image service this should be injected in into the view model using it. However dependency injection  was carried out everywhere else.
